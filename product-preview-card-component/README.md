## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The main learning I had were:

in CSS: 

Using the media tag to resize screen elements for different devices
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px) {
  ...
}
```

### Useful resources

- [@media article on mozila docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/@media) - this article helped me to understand how this CSS tag works, especially in defining the limits for page resizing.
